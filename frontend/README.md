# Artist Portal - NodeSchedular

## Overview

The **Artist Portal** is a core component of the **NodeSchedular** platform, designed to empower artists and business owners to manage their workflow, communicate with clients, and streamline their business operations. 
This portal provides full control over an artist's profile, availability, communication, and payment tracking.

This portal is ideal for businesses such as:

- **Tattoo Shops**
- **Hair Salons**
- **Personal Trainers**
- **Freelance Creators**

By centralizing business management in one place, artists can easily customize their settings, 
respond to client inquiries, book appointments, and monitor payments.

Note: This portal is paired with the **clientSchedular** application: `https://github.com/callen55047/ClientSchedular`
